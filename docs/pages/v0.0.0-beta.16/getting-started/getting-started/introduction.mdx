# What is eventstorage?

An event sourcing framework built for .NET that offers out of the box event storage
infrastructure with event store of choice supporting Azure Sql, Postgres and Sql Server, and
delivers multiple projection styles such as asynchronous, ACID-compliant and runtime.

#### Key benefits of eventstorage

<Note>
* Runs plain SQL resulting in high-performance simple storage infrastructure.
* Flexible schema gains with denormalization and throwing away ORM.
* Identifies aggregates with both `GUID` and `long` and allows switching back and forth.
* Allows selecting event storage of choice with `Azure Sql`, `Postgre Sql` and `Sql Server`.
* Offers multiple projection modes with high-performance asynchronous `Redis` projections.
* Supports dead-letter queues for faulted projection tasks with retriable mechnisms.
* Restores projections at startup ensuring consistency and integrity without blocking business.

<Tip>
es aims to simplify event sourcing and event-driven apps with the means of supporting code
infrastructure out of the box.

## What's next?

Next we jumpstart the installation process and quickly prepare needed dependencies to get started
with code.
- Install .NET 8 SDK that's required by `eventstorage`
- Getting docker container up and running with needed containers
- Creating a dotnet projection solution to host our code infrastructure
- Getting ready to spin up an event storage with provided `EventStorage` package

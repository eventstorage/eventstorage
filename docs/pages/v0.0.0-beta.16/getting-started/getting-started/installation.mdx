# Installation

Follow the steps below to jump start the installation process and prepare the event storage infrastructure.
  <Steps>
    <Steps.Step>
      ### Install `.NET 8` SDK
      
      `es` runs on dotnet 8 and requires the sdk installed:
      ```sh
      https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0
      ```
    </Steps.Step>
    <Steps.Step>
      ### Setup dependencies
      Run mssql or pg database on docker.

      Using `docker-compose`: 
      ```sh
      docker compose --project-name eventstorage up -d
      ```
      Using `docker run` for pg:
      ```sh
      docker run --name some-postgres -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -d postgres
      ```
      Using `docker run` for mssql:
      ```sh
      docker run --name some-mssql -p 1433:1433 -e "ACCEPT_EULA=Y" -e "MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=sysadmin@1234" -d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2019-latest
      ```
      Optionally run `Redis` for high-performance projections:
      ```sh
      docker run -d --name redis-stack -p 6379:6379 -p 8001:8001 redis/redis-stack:latest
      ```
      <Note>
      Once we are done running needed docker containers, we can start setting up eventstorage.
      </Note>
    </Steps.Step>
    <Steps.Step>
      ### Create a dotnet project solution
      To help simplify event sourcing with `eventstorage` framework, let's make use of famous order
      booking example of e-commerce.
      <Steps>
      <Steps.Step>
        Create `order` app folder as the project root for this example and change your directory.
      </Steps.Step>
      <Steps.Step>
        Create a solution by running `dotnet new solution -n Order {:sh}` in the root folder.
      </Steps.Step>
      <Steps.Step>
        Create a `global.json` which specifies project dotnet sdk verison to use by running:
        
        ```sh
        dotnet new globaljson --sdk-version=8.0.405
        ```

        Run `dotnet --list-sdks {:sh}` to list installed sdk versions on your machine.
        
        This is how a typical `global.json` looks like depending on your sdk version:
        ```json title="global.json" showLineNumbers
        {
          "sdk": {
            "version": "8.0.405"
          }
        }
        ```
      </Steps.Step>
      <Steps.Step>
        Create a dotnet webapi project by running `dotnet new webapi -n Order.Api {:sh}`.
      </Steps.Step>
      <Steps.Step>
        Add the webapi to the solution by running `dotnet sln add Order.Api {:sh}`.
      </Steps.Step>
      <Steps.Step>
        Run `dotnet build {:sh}` and it should build the solution properly.
      </Steps.Step>
      </Steps>
    </Steps.Step>
    <Steps.Step>
      ### Get ready to spin up an event storage!
      One last step of the installation tutorial is adding `EventStorage` package to the webapi:
      ```sh
      dotnet add Order.Api package EventStorage --prerelease
      ```
      or `dotnet add package EventStorage --prerelease {:sh}` in the webapi.
    </Steps.Step>
  </Steps>
    

We now have everything setup and are ready to spin up our project with
[EventStorage](https://www.nuget.org/packages/eventstorage) library.

## What's next?

Next we start developing and turning our project into an event sourced solution.
- Use `AddEventStorage` collection extension to add event sourcing configuration
- Select event storage configuration options required to spin up our event storage
- Create aggregate root with `EventSource<TId>` which represents our domain
- Place an order by exposing an api endpoint
- Project placed order and expose another api to query our orders

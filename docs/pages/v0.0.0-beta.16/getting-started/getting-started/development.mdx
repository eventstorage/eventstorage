# Development

This walk through guide gets our api up and running and turns that into an event sourced solution
with the help of `EventStorage` library.

## Use `AddEventStorage` extension

`EventStorage` provides a service collection extension to add event sourcing functionality into our project,
simply open up webapi's `Program.cs` and call `AddEventStorage` extension method.
```csharp title="Program.cs" showLineNumbers
builder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer();
builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen();

builder.Services.AddEventStorage(storage =>
{

});
```

## Select event storage configuration

Use storage configuration option to select event storage of choice: Azure Sql, Postgres or Sql Server.
```csharp title="Program.cs" showLineNumbers
builder.Services.AddEventStorage(storage =>
{
    storage.AddEventSource(source =>
    {
        source.Select(EventStore.PostgresSql, connectionString);
    });
});
```

<Warning>
Ensure connection string is valid. example: `"host=localhost;port=5432;username=postgres;password=postgres;database=es"`
</Warning>

## Add another project for domain

To create aggregate root and its related domain logic, let's create another dotnet project and have
`Order.Api` establish a dependency towards that project:
```sh
dotnet new classlib -n Order
```
Add the new project library to the solution as well:
```sh
dotnet sln add Order
```
Establish a project reference from `Order.Api` to `Order` domain:
```sh
dotnet add Order.Api reference Order
```
Let's also add `EventStorage` pack into our `Order` project:
```sh
dotnet add Order package EventStorage --prerelease
```
We can now remove the package from `Order.Api` as we have the reference to `Order` already:
```sh
dotnet remove Order.Api package EventStorage
```

## Create aggregate root with `EventSource<TId>`

Create aggregate with the help of `EventSource<TId>` where `TId` is either `long` or `Guid`
to identify the aggregate known as event stream/event source in our event storage.

<Note>
While selecting `long` offers lightnening-fast queries and is human readable compared to `Guid`,
we can always switch back and forth between the two!
</Note>

Now let's create `OrderBooking` aggregate root and place that inside `Order` library.

```csharp title="OrderBooking.cs" showLineNumbers
public class OrderBooking : EventSource<long> // or Guid
{
    public OrderStatus OrderStatus { get; private set; }
    public void Apply(OrderPlaced e)
    {
        OrderStatus = OrderStatus.Placed;
    }
    public void PlaceOrder(PlaceOrder command)
    {
        if(OrderStatus == OrderStatus.Placed)
            return;
        RaiseEvent(new OrderPlaced(command));
    }
}
```

This requires `PlaceOrder` command, `OrderPlaced` event and `OrderStatus` to be created:
```csharp
public enum OrderStatus
{
    Draft = 0,
    Placed = 1,
    Confirmed = 2,
}
public record PlaceOrder(string ProductName, int Quantity, string UserId);

public record OrderPlaced(PlaceOrder Command) : SourcedEvent;
```
We have added IoC configuration and created aggregate root, we can now run commands against our
domain aggregate that results in creating event streams.

## Place an order
Expose an endpoint that helps placing an order using `IEventStorage<T>` service.

Add below api endpoint to `Program.cs` of `Order.Api`.

```csharp title="Program.cs"
app.MapPost("api/placeorder", 
async(IEventStorage<OrderBooking> storage, PlaceOrder command) =>
{
    var aggregate = await storage.CreateOrRestore();
    aggregate.PlaceOrder(command);
    await storage.Commit(aggregate);
    return Results.Created("", aggregate.SourceId);
});

app.Run();
```

Let's now run the api with `dotnet run --project Order.Api {:sh}` and place an order through Swagger.
```sh
http(s)://localhost:{port}/swagger
```
Once you execute a request, check your database and get to see the event storage in action.

## Project placed order
One last step of this up and running tutorial is to add a projection and see our order status in action.

<Steps>
<Steps.Step>
Create `OrderProjection` projection with the help of `Projection<M>`.

Place below order projection inside `Order`:

```csharp title="OrderProjection.cs" showLineNumbers
public record OrderDocument(string SourceId, OrderStatus Status, long Version);

public class OrderProjection : Projection<OrderDocument>
{
    public static OrderDocument Project(OrderPlaced orderPlaced) =>
        new(orderPlaced.SourceId?.ToString()?? "", OrderStatus.Placed, orderPlaced.Version);
}
```
<Note>
Notice the flexibility of OrderDocument initialization that turns FP into practice. 
</Note>
</Steps.Step>
<Steps.Step>
Add the projection to our event storage configuration:
```csharp title="Program.cs"
builder.Services.AddEventStorage(storage =>
{
    storage.AddEventSource(source =>
    {
        source.Select(EventStore.PostgresSql, connectionString)
        .Project<OrderProjection>();
    });
});
```
We are now subscribed to `OrderPlaced` event with `OrderProjection` which runs the projection
logic anytime `OrderPlaced` is emitted!
</Steps.Step>
<Steps.Step>
Expose another api to query our orders and pull order status:
```csharp title="Program.cs"
app.MapGet("api/order", async(IEventStorage<OrderBooking> storage, string orderId) => 
    await storage.Project<OrderDocument>(orderId));
```

Restart the api and head over to Swagger again to run the newly created api to query order status.
<Tip>
The framework automatically gets projections synchronized with event storage once restarted, 
</Tip>
</Steps.Step>
</Steps>

## Hooray!! Our api is event sourced and up and running!
## What's next?

We have managed to get our api up and running and placed an order and even projected into a read model.
  - next we dig in further into configuration of our event sourcing and event storage

# Projections

Projection is the process of replaying events of a certain event stream to achieve current state
that can be queried.

`eventstorage` supports all three projections types that are known as ACID-compliant, asynchronous and runtime.

## Projection modes
<Steps>
<Steps.Step>
### `Consistent {:sh}` projection mode

Such type of projection is ACID-compliant and is immediately executed through a transaction that commits
event streams.

```csharp title="Program.cs" showLineNumbers
builder.Services.AddEventStorage(storage =>
{
    storage.AddEventSource(source =>
    {
        source.Select(EventStore.PostgresSql, connectionString)
        .Project<OrderProjection>(ProjectionMode.Consistent);
    });
});
```
```csharp title="OrderProjection.cs" showLineNumbers
public record OrderDetail(string SourceId, OrderStatus Status, long Version);

public class OrderProjection : Projection<OrderDetail>
{
    public static OrderDetail Project(OrderPlaced orderPlaced) =>
        new(orderPlaced.SourceId?.ToString()?? "", OrderStatus.Placed, orderPlaced.Version);
}
```

</Steps.Step>
<Steps.Step>
### `Transient {:sh}` projection mode

This type of projection is a runtime projection and is not persisted anywhere, instead it loads an event
stream and replays them at runtime resulting in a consistent state while performing slower depending on stream
size.

```csharp title="Program.cs" showLineNumbers
builder.Services.AddEventStorage(storage =>
{
    storage.AddEventSource(source =>
    {
        source.Select(EventStore.PostgresSql, connectionString)
        .Project<OrderProjection>(ProjectionMode.Consistent)
        .Project<OrderInfoProjection>(ProjectionMode.Transient);
    });
});
```
```csharp title="OrderInfoProjection.cs" showLineNumbers
public record OrderInfo(string SourceId, OrderStatus Status, long Version);

public class OrderInfoProjection : Projection<OrderInfo>
{
    public static OrderInfo Project(OrderPlaced orderPlaced) =>
        new(orderPlaced.SourceId?.ToString()?? "", OrderStatus.Placed, orderPlaced.Version);
}
```

</Steps.Step>
<Steps.Step>
### `Asynchronous {:sh}` projection mode

This projection mode is a widely-adopted projection style where projections get executed asynchronously through
a a separate worker thread, usually a background service. this mode fits teams where eventual consistency
is not a problem.

```csharp title="Program.cs" showLineNumbers
builder.Services.AddEventStorage(storage =>
{
    storage.AddEventSource(source =>
    {
        source.Select(EventStore.PostgresSql, connectionString)
        .Project<OrderProjection>(ProjectionMode.Consistent)
        .Project<OrderInfoProjection>(ProjectionMode.Transient)
        .Project<OrderDocumentProjection>(ProjectionMode.Async);
    });
});
```
```csharp title="OrderDocumentProjection.cs" showLineNumbers
public record OrderDocument(string SourceId, OrderStatus Status, long Version);

public class OrderDocumentProjection : Projection<OrderDocument>
{
    public static OrderDocument Project(OrderPlaced orderPlaced) =>
        new(orderPlaced.SourceId?.ToString()?? "", OrderStatus.Placed, orderPlaced.Version);
}
```

<Tip>
`Async {:sh}` projection style is the default choice for `eventstorage` and is the default mode when
no projection mode is selected during registering a projection.
</Tip>
</Steps.Step>

## High-performance Redis projections
Our framework offers great projection choices while remaining extremely performant and easy-of-use.

When registering an `async {:sh}` projection, projection source is by default set to selected event storage,
while an optional argument could be passed to set the high-performance key-value `Redis` store as the projection source.

And it's as simple as that:
```csharp title="Program.cs" showLineNumbers
builder.Services.AddEventStorage(storage =>
{
    storage.AddEventSource(source =>
    {
        source.Select(EventStore.PostgresSql, connectionString)
        .Project<OrderProjection>(ProjectionMode.Consistent)
        .Project<OrderInfoProjection>(ProjectionMode.Transient)
        .Project<OrderDocumentProjection>(ProjectionMode.Async)
        .Project<OrderDocProjection>(ProjectionMode.Async, src => src.Redis("redis://localhost:6379"));
    });
});
```
```csharp title="OrderDocProjection.cs" showLineNumbers
[Document(StorageType = StorageType.Json, Prefixes = ["OrderDoc"])]
public class OrderDoc
{
    [RedisIdField][Indexed]
    public string? SourceId { get; set; }
    // [Searchable]
    public OrderStatus Status { get; set; }
    // [Searchable]
    public long Version { get; set; }
}

public class OrderDocProjection : Projection<OrderDoc>
{
    public static OrderDoc Project(OrderPlaced orderPlaced) => new()
    {
        SourceId = orderPlaced.SourceId?.ToString(),
        Version = orderPlaced.Version,
        Status = OrderStatus.Placed
    };
}
```


## Expose projection endpoints

Let's now expose endpoints for the newly created projection views/materialized views.

<Note>
We have previously created a query endpoint for `OrderProjection{:sh}` and we need three more.
</Note>

```csharp title="Program.cs" showLineNumbers
app.MapGet("api/getOrderInfo", async(IEventStorage<OrderBooking> storage, string orderId) => 
    await storage.Project<OrderInfo>(orderId));
app.MapGet("api/getOrderDocument", async(IEventStorage<OrderBooking> storage, string orderId) => 
    await storage.Project<OrderDocument>(orderId));
app.MapGet("api/getOrderDoc", async(IEventStorage<OrderBooking> storage, string orderId) => 
    await storage.Project<OrderDoc>(orderId));
```

Now place another order through our previously created `api/placeOrder {:sh}` and use the response
stream id to query different projection endpoints created.

## Confirm order

This is to further familiarize ourselves with projections and you could skip them to continue on your own!

To make it easy confirming an order, let's follow these steps and conquer the projections.

<Steps>

<Steps.Step>
Create `ConfirmOrder{:sh}` command and `OrderConfirmed {:sh}` event:
```csharp title="ConfirmOrder.cs"
public record ConfirmOrder;

public record OrderConfirmed : SourcedEvent;
```
</Steps.Step>

<Steps.Step>
Add `ConfirmOrder{:sh}` command handler to our aggregate and run business logic:
```csharp title="OrderBooking.cs"
public void ConfirmOrder(ConfirmOrder command)
{
    if(OrderStatus == OrderStatus.Confirmed)
        return;
    RaiseEvent(new OrderConfirmed());
}
```
</Steps.Step>

<Steps.Step>
Apply business logic triggered by `OrderConfirmed{:sh}` into our aggregate:
```csharp title="OrderBooking.cs"
public void Apply(OrderConfirmed e)
{
    OrderStatus = OrderStatus.Confirmed;
}
```

<Caution>
Failing to find `Apply` method for `OrderConfirmed` or not adding it on purpose results in an exception!
</Caution>
</Steps.Step>

<Steps.Step>
Subscribe to `OrderConfirmed {:sh}` for your projections of choice, let's subscribe `OrderDocumentProjection{:sh}`
by adding another `Project` method:
```csharp title="OrderDocumentProjection.cs"
public class OrderDocumentProjection : Projection<OrderDocument>
{
    public static OrderDocument Project(OrderPlaced orderPlaced) =>
        new(orderPlaced.SourceId?.ToString()?? "", OrderStatus.Placed, orderPlaced.Version);
    public static OrderDocument Project(OrderDocument order, OrderConfirmed orderConfirmed) =>
        order with { Status = OrderStatus.Confirmed, Version = orderConfirmed.Version };
}
```

Subscribe Redis `OrderDocProjection{:sh}` as well by adding another `Project` method:
```csharp title="OrderDocProjection.cs"
public static OrderDoc Project(OrderDoc orderDocument, OrderConfirmed orderConfirmed)
{
    orderDocument.Status = OrderStatus.Confirmed;
    orderDocument.Version = orderConfirmed.Version;
    return orderDocument;
}
```

</Steps.Step>

<Steps.Step>
Finnally expose `api/confirmorder{orderId}{:sh}` endpoint to confirm an order:
```csharp title="Program.cs"
app.MapPost("api/confirmorder/{orderId}", 
async(IEventStorage<OrderBooking> storage, string orderId, ConfirmOrder command) =>
{
    var aggregate = await storage.CreateOrRestore(orderId);
    aggregate.ConfirmOrder(command);

    await storage.Commit(aggregate);
});
```

Go ahead and confirm a previously placed order through the new created `api/confirmorder{orderId}{:sh}` api.

Now to get the new order status for both `OrderDocumentProjection` and `OrderDocProjection,` query 
`api/getOrderDocument{:sh}` and `api/getOrderDoc{:sh}` with the confirmed order id.
</Steps.Step>

</Steps>

We have learned how to properly make use of `eventstorage` into making event sourced solutions.

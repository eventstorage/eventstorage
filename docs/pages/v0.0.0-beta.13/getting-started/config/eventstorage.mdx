# Event storage configuration

eventstorage allows a few configuration options to help tailor the infrastructure to developer needs.

The schema and connection string of our event storage is usually placed early into the configuration.

## Schema and connection string

We can define our schema and connection string using the `storage` option or the `source` option
whichever best fits one's needs.

Using `storage` configuration option:

```csharp title="Program.cs" showLineNumbers
builder.Services.AddEventStorage(storage =>
{
    storage.Schema = "es"; // default is es
    storage.ConnectionString = "connection string";
});
```

Using `source` configuration option:
```csharp title="Program.cs" showLineNumbers
builder.Services.AddEventStorage(storage =>
{
    storage.AddEventSource(source =>
    {
        source.Schema = "es"; // default is es
        source.ConnectionString = "connection string";
        source.Select(EventStore.PostgresSql);
    });
});
```

We can also choose to pass connection string to the `Select` extension:
```csharp title="Program.cs" showLineNumbers
builder.Services.AddEventStorage(storage =>
{
    storage.AddEventSource(source =>
    {
        source.Select(EventStore.PostgresSql, connectionString);
    });
});
```

## `EventStorage` schema

`eventstorage` automatically spins up database schema on application start up and creates a few tables.

<Steps>
<Steps.Step>
`EventSources{:sh}` this is the core `eventstorage` table persisting event streams using a flexible schema,
since business decision changes are very frequent and we can't afford re-migrating our database and end up
with lots of nullable fields, thefore business data is placed in json fields.
</Steps.Step>
<Steps.Step>
`Checkpoints{:sh}` the framework makes use of this table to keep track of asyncchronous projections and ensures
no pending events are missed using an asynchronous projection engine called `AsyncProjectionEngine.`
we also make use of this table later to dispatch into message broker of choice.
</Steps.Step>

<Steps.Step>
Projections: any projection registered into our `eventstorage` configuration ends up with a table named after
the read model followed by an `s{:sh}` postfix. for example using `Order` read model in `OrderProjection`
creates a table under `Orders{:sh}` holding all of the documents of that certain read model.
</Steps.Step>
</Steps>

## Event storage of choice

We can select our event store of choice. `AzureSql{:sh}`, `Postgres{:sh}` and `SqlServer{:sh}` are supported
so far homefully including EventStoreDb in the upcoming releases.

Using `Select` extension, we pass our event store selection and optionally a connection string:
```csharp titl="Program.cs" showLineNumbers
builder.Services.AddEventStorage(storage =>
{
    storage.AddEventSource(source =>
    {
        source.Select(EventStore.AzureSql, connectionString);
        // where event store can either be AzureSql, PostgreSql or SqlServer
    });
});
```

## What's next?

Now that we learned how to configure our event storage with basic settings, next we:
  - Learn different projection modes supported by `eventstorage`
  - Learn high-performance projections stored on `key-value` store `Redis`
  - Expose projection endpoints to query different types of projections
  - Confirm order and learn how to subscribe projections with events of our choice

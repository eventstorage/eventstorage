# What is eventstorage?

A high-performance event sourcing framework built for dotnet offering the event storage of choice
with Azure Sql, Postgres and Sql Server, and delivers multiple projection modes with support to
Redis for high-performance asynchronous projections.

#### Key benefits of eventstorage
* Runs plain sql resulting in high-performance storage infrastructure 
* Flexible schema gains with denormalization and throwing away ORM
* Identifies aggregates with `GUID` and `long` and allows switching back and forth
* Lightning-fast storage operations by selecting `long` aggregate identifier
* Allows event storage selection with `Azure Sql`, `Postgre Sql` and `Sql Server`
* Offers transient/runtime, ACID-compliant and async projections modes
* Allows projection source as either selected storage or high-performance `Redis`
* Lightweight asynchronous projection engine that polls for async projections
* Restores projections at startup ensuring consistency without blocking business
* Designed to survive failures and prevents possible inconsistencies

## Installation

Follow the steps below to jump start the installation and prepare the event storage infrastructure.
  <Steps>
    <Steps.Step>
      ### Install `.NET 8` SDK
      
      `es` runs on dotnet 8 and requires the sdk installed:
      ```sh
      https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0
      ```
    </Steps.Step>
    <Steps.Step>
      ### Setup dependencies
      Run mssql or pg database on docker.

      Using `docker-compose`: 
      ```sh
      docker compose --project-name eventstorage up -d
      ```
      Using `docker run` for pg:
      ```sh
      docker run --name some-postgres -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -d postgres
      ```
      Using `docker run` for mssql:
      ```sh
      docker run --name some-mssql -p 1433:1433 -e "ACCEPT_EULA=Y" -e "MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=sysadmin@1234" -d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2019-latest
      ```
      Optionally run `Redis` for high-performance projections:
      ```sh
      docker run -d --name redis-stack -p 6379:6379 -p 8001:8001 redis/redis-stack:latest
      ```
    </Steps.Step>
    <Steps.Step>
      ### Create a dotnet web api project
      <Steps>
      Once we have are done running needed docker dependencies, we can start setting up eventstorage.
      <Note>
        These steps are for starters and you could probably skip them if you are an experienced dotnet.
      </Note>
      <Steps.Step>
        Create your app folder, `order-app` for instance then get inside of the folder and
        create a `global.json` file which specifies project net sdk verison by running: 
        
        ```sh
        dotnet new globaljson --sdk-version=8.0.401
        ```

        Run `dotnet --list-sdks {:sh}` to list installed sdk versions on your machine if you are not
        sure which ones you've installed.
        
        This is how a `global.json` looks like depending on your sdk version:
        ```json title="global.json" showLineNumbers
        {
          "sdk": {
            "version": "8.0.401"
          }
        }
        ```
      </Steps.Step>
      <Steps.Step>
        Create a solution by running `dotnet new solution -n Order {:sh}` inside of the folder.
      </Steps.Step>
      <Steps.Step>
        Create `src` folder followed by creating a dotnet api project inside of `src` folder with
        `dotnet new webapi -n Order.Api {:sh}`
      </Steps.Step>
      <Steps.Step>
        Get back to the root folder and add the api project to the solution with `dotnet sln
        Order.sln add src\Order.Api --in-root {:sh}`.
      </Steps.Step>
      <Steps.Step>
        Finally run `dotnet build {:sh}` and it should build the solution properly.
      </Steps.Step>
      </Steps>
    </Steps.Step>
    <Steps.Step>
      ### Get ready to spin up an event storage!
      One last step of the installation tutorial is adding `EventStorage`
      package into our api project by running the following in the root folder:
      ```sh
      dotnet add src\Order.Api package EventStorage --prerelease
      ```
      or `dotnet add package EventStorage --prerelease {:sh}` inside of api project.
    </Steps.Step>
  </Steps>
    

We have everything setup now and are ready to spin up our project with `eventstorage` library.

## What's next?

Next we start developing and turning our project into an event sourced solution
with [EventStorage](https://www.nuget.org/packages/eventstorage/readme.md) library:
- Use `AddEventStorage` collection extension to add event sourcing configuration
- Select event storage configuration options required to spin up our event storage
- Create aggregate root with `EventSource<TId>` which represents our domain
- Place an order by exposing an api endpoint
- Project placed order and expose another api to query our orders

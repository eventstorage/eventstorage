# Development

This walk through guide explains the development process in turning our project into an event sourced solution.

Get our api project up and running quickly with `eventstorage` following steps down below.

## Use `AddEventStorage` collection extension

`eventstorage` provides an extension to service collection to add event sourcing functionality into our project,
simply open up `Program.cs` from api project and call `AddEventStorage` against the service collection.
```csharp title="Program.cs" showLineNumbers
builder.Services.AddEventStorage(storage =>
{
    
});
```

<Note>
Again you can skip these steps if you are experienced and get yourself packed with self-explaining configuration.
</Note>

## Select event storage configuration

Use storage configuration option to select event storage of choice among Azure Sql, Postgres or Sql Server.
```csharp title="Program.cs" showLineNumbers
builder.Services.AddEventStorage(storage =>
{
    storage.AddEventSource(source =>
    {
        source.Select(EventStore.PostgresSql, connectionString);
    });
});
```

<Warning>
Ensure connection string is valid. example: `host=localhost;port=5432;username=postgres;password=postgres;database=es`
</Warning>

## Create aggregate root with `EventSource<TId>`

Define your aggregate with the help of `EventSource<TId>` where `TId` can be either `long` or `Guid`
to identify event streams/event sources in our event storage.

<Note>
Selecting `long` as stream identifier offers lightnening-fast stream access and is more human readable. 
</Note>

To create aggregate root and its corresponding domain logic, let's create another project as `Order` and place
our domain inside by running the following in project root:
```sh
dotnet new classlib -o src\Order
```
Add the new project library to the solution as well:
```sh
dotnet sln Order.sn add src\Order --in-root
```
An `Order` reference to `Order.Api` is required as we establish a dependency towards our `Order` domain:
```sh
dotnet add src\Order.Api reference src\Order
```
We also need to add `EventStorage` pack into our `Order` project:
```sh
dotnet add src\Order package EventStorage --prerelease
```

Now place below `OrderBooking` aggregate root inside of `Order` library.

```csharp title="OrderBooking.cs" showLineNumbers
public class OrderBooking : EventSource<long> // or Guid
{
    public OrderStatus OrderStatus { get; private set; }
    public void Apply(OrderPlaced e)
    {
        OrderStatus = OrderStatus.Placed;
    }
    public void PlaceOrder(PlaceOrder command)
    {
        if(OrderStatus == OrderStatus.Placed)
            return;
        RaiseEvent(new OrderPlaced(command));
    }
}
```

As we can see this requires `PlaceOrder` command, `OrderPlaced` event and `OrderStatus` to be created:
```csharp showLineNumbers
public enum OrderStatus
{
    Draft = 0,
    Placed = 1,
    Confirmed = 2,
}
public record PlaceOrder(string ProductName, int Quantity, string UserId);

public record OrderPlaced(PlaceOrder Command) : SourcedEvent;
```

## Place an order
Let's now go ahead and expose an endpoint that helps placing an order using `IEventStorage<T>` service.

Add below api to `Program.cs` of `Order.Api`.

```csharp title="Program.cs" showLineNumbers
app.MapPost("api/placeorder", 
async(IEventStorage<OrderBooking> storage, PlaceOrder command) =>
{
    var aggregate = await storage.CreateOrRestore();
    aggregate.PlaceOrder(command);
 
    await storage.Commit(aggregate);
 
    return Results.Ok(aggregate.SourceId);
});

app.Run();
```

Run the api with `dotnet run --project src\Order.Api {:sh}` and access Swagger through provided link
to quickly place an order.
```sh
http(s)://localhost:{port}/swagger
```

Once you execute a request, check your database and get to see the event storage.

## Project placed order

This is the last step of this up and running tutorial where we add a projection and see our order status in action.

<Steps>
<Steps.Step>
Create `OrderProjection` projection with the help of `Projection<M>`.

Place below order projection inside of `Order` project:

```csharp title="OrderProjection.cs" showLineNumbers
public record OrderDetail(string SourceId, OrderStatus Status, long Version);

public class OrderProjection : Projection<OrderDetail>
{
    public static OrderDetail Project(OrderPlaced orderPlaced) =>
        new(orderPlaced.SourceId?.ToString()?? "", OrderStatus.Placed, orderPlaced.Version);
}
```
</Steps.Step>
<Steps.Step>
Add the projection to our event source configuration:
```csharp title="Program.cs" showLineNumbers
builder.Services.AddEventStorage(storage =>
{
    storage.Schema = "es";
    storage.AddEventSource(source =>
    {
        source.Select(EventStore.PostgresSql, connectionString)
        .Project<OrderProjection>();
    });
});
```
</Steps.Step>
<Steps.Step>
Expose another api to query our orders and pull order status:
```csharp title="Program.cs" showLineNumbers
app.MapGet("api/getOrder", async(IEventStorage<OrderBooking> storage, string orderId) => 
    await storage.Project<OrderDetail>(orderId));
```

Restart the api and head over to Swagger again to run the newly created api to query order status.
</Steps.Step>
</Steps>

## Hooray!! Our api is event sourced and up and running!
## What's next?

We have managed to get our api up and running and we even placed an order and projected into a read model.
  - next we dive deeper into further configuration of our event source
